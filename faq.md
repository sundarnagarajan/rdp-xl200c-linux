### How to report a problem
- Open an issue on github
- You will need a github account

**AT LEAST** provide the following information when you open an issue:
1. Did you use one of the pre-compiled remastered ISOs? If so, which one?
2. If you remastered your own ISO, what was the source ISO (distribution, version, 32-bit or 64-bit)?
3. Did you install on to the main SSD or to an external (USB) medium?
4. While partitioning your target disk during installation, did you create (and use) a **GPT** partition table and an EFI partition?
5. What was the **EXACT** error message you saw, if any, and **at what stage** of install etc
6. Which model of hardware are you using? Sometimes the hardware inside changes, while the model number on the box does not. Provide the following:
    - Link to site where you bought the hardware
    - Output of dmidecode command and dmesg command - most useful
    - Any other information on sticker on the hardware to identify product model, version
